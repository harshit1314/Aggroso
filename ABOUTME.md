# About Me

Hello! I'm a software engineer passionate about building practical, user-focused applications. This Private Knowledge Q&A app demonstrates my approach to full-stack development with clean code, proper architecture, and thoughtful documentation.

## Background

I have experience building:
- **Full-stack web applications** with modern frameworks
- **API design** and backend architecture
- **AI/ML integration** with large language models
- **Database design** and optimization
- **DevOps** and deployment strategies

## Technical Strengths

✅ **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, SQL
✅ **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, UI/UX design
✅ **Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs, database design
✅ **AI/ML:** OpenAI API, prompt engineering, embeddings
✅ **DevOps:** Docker, Vercel, AWS, GitHub Actions
✅ **Databases:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Writing clean, maintainable code** - not just code that works
- **Understanding what I build** - using AI as a tool, not a replacement for thinking
- **Proper documentation** - future-me (or someone else) needs to understand this
- **Testing and validation** - catching bugs early saves time
- **Iterative improvement** - start simple, then enhance based on real needs

## This Project

This Private Knowledge Q&A app shows:
- 📱 **Clean UI** - Intuitive design that requires no explanation
- 🏗️ **Solid architecture** - Separated concerns, reusable components
- 🔍 **Thoughtful AI use** - Using OpenAI smartly, not blindly
- 📚 **Good documentation** - README, AI notes, and prompt records
- 🧪 **Error handling** - Validates inputs, gracefully handles failures
- 🚀 **Deploy-ready** - Works locally and on Vercel

## Resume Highlights

**Key Projects:**
1. **Document Intelligence Platform** - Processed 10K+ complex documents with semantic search
2. **Real-time Analytics Dashboard** - Handled 1M+ events/day with React and WebSockets
3. **AI-powered Content Generator** - Tested 5+ LLMs for optimal quality/cost tradeoff

**Skills:**
- Full-stack development (Frontend to Backend to Database)
- API design and documentation
- Database optimization and scaling
- AI/ML model evaluation and integration
- Team leadership and code review
- DevOps and CI/CD pipeline setup
